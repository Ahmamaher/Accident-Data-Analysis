# 🚗 Accident Data Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes accident data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help improve road safety. The analysis was performed using **Tableau** for visualization and **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** for data cleaning and preparation.

## 📊 Key Features
- **Interactive Tableau Dashboard** with filters and navigation.
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation** performed in Python (Jupyter Notebook/Colab).
- **KPI Metrics:** Total accidents, severity distribution, casualties, and high-risk areas.
- **Storytelling with Data:** A structured report summarizing key insights.

## 📁 Files Included
- `Accident_Analysis.twb` → Tableau dashboard file.
- `Data_Cleaning.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning.
- `Accident_Data_Cleaned.csv` → Processed dataset.
- `Data_Insights_Report.pdf` → Analytical report with key insights.
- `README.md` → Project documentation (this file).

## 🔍 Data Cleaning Process
- **Handled missing values** in location and vehicle details.
- **Converted date formats** and extracted useful time-based insights.
- **Standardized categorical values** for consistency.

## 📈 Key Insights
1. **Peak Accident Hours:** Most accidents occur between 6 PM - 9 PM.
2. **Weather Impact:** Rainy conditions significantly increase accident severity.
3. **High-Risk Areas:** Certain districts have a higher concentration of accidents.
4. **Casualty Trends:** High vehicle density correlates with more severe accidents.
